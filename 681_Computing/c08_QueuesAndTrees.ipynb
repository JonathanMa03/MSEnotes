    "- every node has the root node as an ancestor (parent of a parent of a parent ...)\n",

    "# Priority Queues and Heaps\n",
    "\n",
    "A priority queue is a data structure where we store items that can be ordered by priority. Priority of an iterm is determined by a numerical value with the smaller value receiving highter priority (sorry but that is the standard way of defining priority - maybe best to think of position of objects in a line numbered 0,1,... so the the 0th position gets higher priority). The data structure supports the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- insert - adding a new pair (object, priority) to the queue\n",
    "- pop - returning the element from the queue with highest priority (lowest i-value) and removing it from the queue\n",
    "- peek - inspecting the highest priority item without removing it\n",
    "- determining the number of elements left in the queue without making any changes\n",
    "\n",
    "We want these operations to be efficient and it turns out that a priority queue can be efficiently implemented using a heap, which is a *complete binary tree structure* as described above with items stored at the nodes. Importantly, \n",
    "\n",
    "- the binary tree has the *heap property*: a parent is always at least as high priority as its children, and\n",
    "- the operations described above can be carried out efficiently.\n",
    "    - insertion - to insert an element, we add a node at the deepest depth and to the right of any existing nodes at that depth, or add a new depth and place the node at the leftmost position at that depth, then repeatedly swap its position with a parent whose priority is lower until its parent has higher priority (this is called bubbling up)\n",
    "    - pop - return the first element of the list and then replace it by the last element, then repeatedly swap this element with a child if one of them has higher priority until it has at least as high priority as its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap will be *balanced*, meaning that the distance between a *leaf* (a node with no children) and the root node having one of two possible values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency of the heap** The operations above will each take at most $C\\log2(n)$ operations where $n$ is the number of objects stored and $C$ is a constant representing the cost of a pair of comparisons and swapping of two list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let i = index of newly inserted element.\n",
    "- Let p = floor[(i - 1) / 2.]\n",
