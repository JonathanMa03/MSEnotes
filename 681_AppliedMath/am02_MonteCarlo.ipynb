    "## **1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Delta Method** is a fundamental tool for obtaining **approximations to moments** (mean, variance, covariance) of random variables that are smooth functions of other random variables with known moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea:\n",
    "If a random variable $X$ is concentrated near its mean $\\mu_X$, and $f$ is a smooth function, then the distribution of $f(X)$ is approximately concentrated near $f(\\mu_X)$.  \n",
    "This allows us to approximate:\n",
    "- $E[f(X)]$\n",
    "- $\\operatorname{Var}[f(X)]$\n",
    "- and in higher dimensions, $\\operatorname{Cov}[f(U,V)]$\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose $X$ has mean $\\mu_X$ and variance $\\sigma_X^2$.  \n",
    "We assume $\\sigma_X$ is small, so $X$ is concentrated around $\\mu_X$.  \n",
    "Let $f$ be a sufficiently smooth function near $\\mu_X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a **second-order Taylor expansion** about $\\mu_X$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) \\approx f(\\mu_X) + f'(\\mu_X)(x - \\mu_X) + \\tfrac{1}{2}f''(\\mu_X)(x - \\mu_X)^2\n",

    "## **7. Explanation of the Acceptance–Rejection Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is justified by three geometric facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniform sampling under $cg(x)$:**  \n",
    "   If $g$ is a pdf, sampling $X\\sim g$ and, conditional on $X$,  \n",
    "   $Y\\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0,cg(X))$ gives $(X,Y)$ uniformly distributed  \n",
    "   in $ D_{cg} = \\{(x,y):0\\le y \\le c g(x)\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uniform acceptance principle:**  \n",
    "   If $ D_1 \\subset D_2 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2 $ have positive area and we sample uniformly  \n",
    "   from $D_2$ until a point falls in $D_1$, the accepted point is uniform on $D_1$.  \n",
    "   The number of trials $N$ has geometric distribution  \n",
    "   $ P(N=k)=p(1-p)^{k-1} $ with $p = |D_1|/|D_2|$;  \n",
    "   thus $E[N]=1/p=c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Marginal distribution property:**  \n",
    "   If $f$ is a pdf and we sample uniformly from  \n",
    "   $ \\{(x,y):0\\le y \\le f(x)\\} $, then the marginal $X$ has density $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together these justify that the algorithm yields samples $ X\\sim f $.\n",
